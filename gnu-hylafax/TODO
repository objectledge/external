gnu.hylafax TODO

These are items that have yet to be implemented or are part of the
general wish list for gnu.hylafax.  You can contribute to this program
and get your name permanently embedded in the distribution if you care 
to take on any of these tasks.  See the contact info in the README.

- write equivalents to any useful HylaFAX client programs in pure Java

I'm talking about sendfax, faxstat, etc.  These would be useful as 
both example software and for general use.  See gnu.hylafax.util.SendFax 
for a start, it's far from done.

Preliminary findings indicate that it may be tricky to fully implement
some of these client programs because of the information they get from
the environment.  AFAIK, Java applications cannot get to certain types
of information in their environment (environment variables anyone) but
this limitation can be worked around by using shell-script wrappers.

I've also noticed that some of the software (sendfax?) call other 
HylaFAX utilities internally for things such as checking the dialrules.  I'm
not too keen on rewriting ALL of HylaFAX in Java, just some useful functions.

Once this step is complete (or at least started) we can move on to 
GUI applications.

- implement 'make test' functionality

Need test cases to be implemented so the classes can be tested in an
automated way.  Some test cases can also be found in the main() method 
of HylaFAXClient, they should be (re)moved eventually.

maybe look into "junit" for this.

- investigate Apache's Ant for portable builds

- EJB/RMI wrappers for these classes

- build system packages (deb, rpm, Solaris pkg?)

KNOWN PROBLEMS

- The utility programs echo the password dialog to the screen
