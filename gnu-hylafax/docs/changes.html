<ul>
  <B>0.0.7</B> (12 Jul 2002)<BR>
  <li>moved mdtm to gnu.inet.ftp.FtpClientProtocol, changed to return
    an instance of java.util.Date
  <li>added rnfr, rnto and rename
</ul>
<p>

<ul>
  <B>0.0.6</B> (25 Jun 2002)<BR>
  Internal release
  <li>FTP (gnu.inet.ftp) has been further tested and tweaked
  <li>Renamed the FTP package at the GNU project's request to conform
	to their Java package naming conventions.  The package name
	was changed from gnu.net.ftp to gnu.inet.ftp.  This is in
	preparation for this package to be donated to the GNU
	project's codebase.
  <li>Built and tested with JDK 1.4
  <li>Various bug fixes, thanks to the bug reporters
</ul>
<P>

<ul>
  <B>0.0.5</B> (08 Jun 2001)<BR>
  A bunch of updates (I may miss some in this changelog)
  <li>Separated the FTP (RFC959) functionality from the HylaFAX
    protocol.  FTP is the superclass of the HylaFAX protocol;
    HylaFAX extends FTP.  FTP is found in the gnu.net.ftp package
    included in this distribution.  At a later date, it will be moved
    to another distribution, after it stabilizes.  Applications that
    use HylaFAXClient should be unchanged.
  <li>Transfer status callbacks have been implemented
  <li>Error status callbacks have been implemented
  <li>gnu.hylafax.util.FaxStat utility is complete.  It generally offers
    the same functionality and options as the HylaFAX faxstat command.
  <li>gnu.hylafax.util.SendFax utility is complete.  It generally offers
    the same functionality and options as the HylaFAX sendfax command.
  <li>Compressed data transfers have been implemented
  <li>A gnu.hylafax.Job class now exists and is integrated with
    gnu.hylafax.HylaFAXClient to allow access to job parameters (in
    place of jparm().)  See gnu.hylafax.util.SendFax for an example
    of using this new class.
  <li>The core FTP implementation has been further fleshed out.  I
    spent some time digging through the FTP RFC (RFC959) in order
    to do this.
</ul>
<P>

<ul>
  <B>0.0.4</B> (21 Jun 2000)<BR>
  <li>fixed an inconsistency in the *Fmt commands.  jobfmt() has been fixed to
  act like the others.
  <li>fixed a bug in passive mode transfers.  When an error occurred (e.g.
  FileNotFoundException) during passive transfers, the next data connection
  would fail with an exception.  passive connection sockets are cached until
  they are used, which seems to be the way the HylaFAX server works.
  <li>began implementing status callback interfaces.  Check out the
  Connection* classes to see what's new.
  <li>separated the core command protocol from wrapper, convenience 
  functionality.  the core command protocol is now in the 
  gnu.hylafax.HylaFAXClientProtocol class whereas the wrapper functions 
  can be found in the gnu.hylafax.HylaFAXClient class.
  <li>at users' requests, there are separate Makefile targets for the
  gnu.hylafax and gnu.hylafax.util package jar files.  This will allow
  a light weight protocol jar to be deployed without any util baggage.
  Right now gnu.hylafax.util is tiny so this doesn't really matter but
  in the future I hope there are lots of utils.
</ul>
<P>

<ul>
  <B>0.0.3</B> (31 May 2000)<BR>
  <li>the project is now in CVS for internal change control.
  <li>removed calls to Thread.stop() to hopefully solve a deadlock problem.  Rumor has it that Java 2 deprecates Thread.stop() anyway.
  <li>removed a bug in stor() that may have had something to do with the deadlocks too.
  <li>implemented passive mode data transfers.  Check out setPassive() for toggling modes.  Default mode is not passive.
</ul>
<P>

<ul>

  <li>First public release.
  <li>Added docs/index.html
  <li>Added docs/credits.html
  <li>Added docs/changes.html
  <li>Moved api docs to docs/api/
</ul>
<P>

<ul>
  <B>0.0.1</B> (25 January 2000)<BR>
  <li>First release, internal.
  <li>All files present with the exception of some basic docs.
  <li>Needs webpage (will double as basic docs.)
</ul>
