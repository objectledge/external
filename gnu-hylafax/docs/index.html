<H2>Description</H2>
The gnu.hylafax package is a pure-Java implementation of the HylaFAX (FAX
server) client protocol.  The gnu.hylafax package can be used to implement
a HylaFAX client that will run on any Java-supporting system.
<p>
The current release of this software includes an FTP client implementation
in the gnu.inet.ftp package.  We've worked to make this library compliant
with the <a href="rfc0959.txt">FTP RFC, RFC0959</a>.
<p>

<H2>Technical Notes</H2>
The current implementation is intended to directly
export the HylaFAX protocol with few "niceties."  Therefore, the API does
not implement things the Java way, yet.  By the Java way, I mean proper getX and
setX methods.
<p>
It is my intention to provide a more developer friendly API on top of the
current API as development continues.  I'm still formulating this higher-level
API, so speak up if you'd like to offer suggestions.
<p>
The gnu.hylafax package is pretty useless without a working installation
of the <a href="http://www.hylafax.org/">HylaFAX</a> FAX server.  The 
gnu.hylafax based client can be run on any Java supporting system with 
internet access to the HylaFAX server (local or remote.)  For more information
on HylaFAX, see the <a href="http://www.hylafax.org/">website</a>.
<p>
For more information on planned features, check out the TODO file in the
<a href="#latest">latest archive</a>.
