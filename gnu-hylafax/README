Library General Public License.  See the COPYING.LIB file for details.
Some included utilities are distributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License, a copy of which is included in the file COPYING.

INSTALLATION

Copy the gnu-hylafax-0.0.7.jar file (located in the 'lib' directory)
to your usual installation directory for Java archives.

To use gnu.hylafax, you will need to include it in your classpath
setting.  Typically this is done by adding an entry to your CLASSPATH
variable setting with the full path to the JAR file, e.g.
  csh:  % setenv CLASSPATH ${CLASSPATH}:/usr/java/lib/gnu-hylafax-0.0.7.jar
 bash:  % export CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:/usr/java/lib/gnu-hylafax-0.0.7.jar
  DOS:  > set CLASSPATH %CLASSPATH%;C:\Java\lib\gnu-hylafax-0.0.7.jar
Various shells and operating systems may have slightly different methods.
Consult your Java virtual machine documentation for details.  You may also
specify the -classpath option to the java executable, e.g.
compile: % javac -classpath /usr/java/lib/gnu-hylafax-0.0.7.jar MyClass.java
execute: % java -classpath /usr/java/lib/gnu-hylafax-0.0.7.jar MyClass

DOCUMENTATION

HTML documentation is provided in the 'docs' directory.
The documentation files are:
 docs/*.html     -- general docs/website
 docs/api/*.html -- javadoc generated info

UTILITIES

gnu.hylafax comes with some simple utility programs intended to test
and demonstrate its features.  At this time, the gnu.hylafax.util.SendFax
and gnu.hylafax.util.FaxStat programs are included in their own JAR file.

HACKING

You are free to fold, spindle, mutilate and modify this library,
provided you follow the terms outlined in COPYING.LIB.  The gnu.hylafax
project team gratefully accepts any bug fixes or enhancements you may
come up with (see the TODO file if you're in need of some ideas). A
few parameters at the top of the Makefile in the 'src' directory
need to be edited to match your local system setup.

We would prefer changes in the form of GNU-style diff files but won't be
too picky about it.

BUG REPORTS

Send bug reports to <jaiger@innovationsw.com>.  It helps if you can send 
a code sample showing how you were using gnu.hylafax.  It may also be helpful
to show the correct/expected behavior (say sendfax -vv) if it can be shown
with another HylaFAX client.
