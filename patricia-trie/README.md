# PATRICIA Trie

*Practical Algorithm to Retrieve Information Coded in Alphanumeric*

This is a general purpose implementation of a PATRICIA Trie in Java. It implements the [SortedMap](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/SortedMap.html) interface and integrates well with the [Java Collections Framework](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/collections). You can use any kind of Objects for Keys as long as they can be accessed bit-wise. You can find [examples](http://code.google.com/p/patricia-trie/wiki/Examples) in the [wiki](http://code.google.com/p/patricia-trie/w/list) and there is a [blog post](http://www.kapsi.de/blog/?p=67) with some additional information about the implementation.

The PATRICIA Trie is also known under the names [Radix and Crit Bit Tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATRICIA).

**Download:** Binaries can be found on the project's [Google Code Page](http://code.google.com/p/patricia-trie).
