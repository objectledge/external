<p>The XBIS encoding format mirrors the standard text form of an XML
document in that all components of the document are present in the
same order they'd appear in text. What differs is that XBIS uses a
more compact representation of the components, and presents them in a
more easily processed form.</p>
<p>The compactness comes mainly from taking advantage of the highly
repetitive structure of a normal XML document, where the same element
and attribute names are typically used many times over. XBIS defines
each name as text only once, then uses a <b>handle</b> value to refer
back to the name when it is repeated. This same approach is used with
namespaces, so that even namespace prefixes are not repeated as
text.</p>
<p>XBIS can also apply this approach to attribute values and
character data, which often use the same text repeatedly. The extent
to which this is done is an encoding option, but does not actually
effect the format itself; a reader does not need to know what options
were used to generate the encoding in order to build a document
representation from the encoded form. This is an important concern for
general usage, since it allows documents to be exchanged between XBIS
users without the need for any external information (such as a schema,
or parameter settings).</p>
<p>Besides the more compact representation, XBIS gains speed on the
input side by presenting the document data in predigested form. This
eliminates the need for any complex parsing of the input and allows
the document to be reconstructed with minimal overhead.</p>

<h3>Building Blocks</h3>
<p>The XBIS encoding builds up from several simple types. These
simple types are described in this section.</p>

<table align=left cellpadding=5>
<caption><b>Figure 1. Integer value representations</b></caption>
<tr><td><img src="images/int-value-reps.gif" alt="Integer value representations" align=left width=315 height=445/></td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Integer Values</h4>
<p>Positive integer values are used extensively in the encoding. The
standard format of representing these values uses the low-order 7
bits of a byte for the actual value representation, with the
high-order 8th bit used as a continuation flag - when the 8th bit is
set, the next byte in the encoded stream contains another 7 bits of
the value.</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows how this looks when applied to values of various
sizes. Values in the range of 0-127 can be represented in a single
byte, as shown in the top image. Values of 128-16383 require two
bytes, as shown in the second image (where the upper byte comes first
in the encoded form). Larger values require more bytes, all the way
to a maximum of five bytes to represent the maximum possible integer
value. In actual use, the values being encoded can generally be
represented in one or two bytes.</p>
<h4>Quick Values</h4>
<p>Quick values are a way of representing a limited range of positive
integer values within a portion of a byte. This format is often used
in combination with flags in a byte. When a value is to be encoded in
this manner it is first incremented. If the incremented value fits
within the portion of the byte allowed for the quick value, the value
is stored directly within the byte. Otherwise, a <code>0</code> is
stored within the byte and the incremented value is encoded in the
following byte(s) using the normal integer value encoding defined
above.</p>
<h4>Strings</h4>
<p>Strings are the basic building blocks of the serial form. The
general string format uses a leading length value which gives the
number of characters (<b>not</b> bytes) in the string, plus one. The
value <code>0</code> is used for a <code>null</code> string, as
opposed to the value <code>1</code> which represents a string of zero
characters.</p>
<p>This length value is encoded as a normal integer value, as
described above. It is followed immediately by the actual characters
of the string. Each 16-bit Java character is also encoded as an
integer value, so the length of the string data in bytes can
potentially be up to three times the number of characters in the
string (but for characters in the standard ASCII range the length in
bytes will be the same as the number of characters).</p>
<p>String lengths can also be encoded as quick values in some cases.
These work slightly differently in that the actual character length
of the string is encoded as a quick value, rather than the
length-plus-one value used in the general format. Since there is no
way of representing a <code>null</code> string with this encoding,
quick values are used for string lengths only when the string is
required to be non-<code>null</code>.</p>
<h4>Handles</h4>
<p>Handle values are used to refer to previously defined items, which
include element and attribute names, namespaces (both active and
defined), namespace URIs, and
optionally attribute value and character data strings. Each type of
item listed uses a separate set of handles in order to keep the
handle values as small as possible, giving the most efficient
encoding. The context of a handle reference always determines which
type of handle is being referenced.</p>
<p>Actual values start at <code>1</code>. Except for namespaces
(which use a pair of predefined handles), a handle value of <code>1</code>
will always represent the first item defined of that type, a handle
of <code>2</code> the second, and so on.</p>
<p>A <code>0</code> in a handle value is used to indicate that a new
item of the appropriate type is being defined. The new item is
implicitly assigned the next handle value of that type and may then
be referenced by that handle value later in the encoding.</p>
<p>When handles are encoded in quick value fields the actual value
stored is one greater than the handle value, since as described above
the quick value format makes special use of the <code>0</code> value.
In this case a <code>1</code> indicates that a new item is being
defined.</p>

<h4>Names and Namespaces</h4>
<p>Element and attribute name definitions use a common format.
The first byte of the definition, shown in Figure 2, contains a quick
value field for an active namespace handle, along with a separate quick
value field for the local name length.
</p>

<table align=left cellpadding=5>
<caption><b>Figure 2. Name definition byte</b></caption>
<tr><td><img src="images/names.gif" alt="Name definition byte" align=left width=315 height=43/></td></tr>
</table>

<p>If the active namespace handle value is larger than can be represented in the quick
value field (indicated by a <code>0</code> value in the field), the actual handle
value immediately follows this definition byte. Two active namespace handles are
predefined. Handle <code>1</code> is always assigned to the <b>no namespace</b>
namespace, and handle <code>2</code> is always assigned to the <b>xml</b>
namespace. Other namespaces are assigned active handles as they're declared,
which may be reused for other namespaces outside the range of the first
declaration.</p>

<p>If the namespace used for a name has not previously been defined it may be
included in the name definition. This uses the handle value <code>0</code> to
indicate a new definition (as discussed in the section on <b>Handles</b>,
above). In this case the name definition byte is followed by the actual
namespace definition, starting with a byte of the form shown in Figure 3. Here
one quick value field gives the namespace URI handle, while the second quick
value field gives the prefix length. This first byte of the namespace definition
is optionally followed by the encoded characters of the namespace URI (if this
is the first time that URI has been used, as indicated by a handle value
of <code>0</code>), and then by the encoded characters of the prefix (if
any).</p>

<table align=left cellpadding=5>
<caption><b>Figure 3. Namespace definition lead byte</b></caption>
<tr><td><img src="images/namespace.gif" alt="Namespace definition lead byte" align=left width=315 height=43/></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Going back to the basic name definition, the additional information for
the local name is encoded after any additional information for the namespace.
If the name length quick value field in the name definition byte is too small
to hold the length, the full length follows any namespace information. It is
followed by the encoded characters of the local name.</p>

<h3>Structure Encoding</h3>

<p>XBIS is a stream encoding which is mainly intended for use with
single documents. However, the format allows for encoding arbitrary
combinations of elements and documents, and there are cases where
this may be very useful to an application. Consider the case where
multiple documents of the same type are being transferred from one
program to another, for instance. The first document encoded would
define most or all of the element and attribute names used in the
entire series of documents, allowing the names to be referenced as
simple handles in all the following encoded documents.</p>

<p>Each XBIS stream starts with four bytes reserved for XBIS itself.
The first byte is a format identifier, which is set by the encoder to
specify the format version used to encode the document and checked by
the decoder to ensure that it is able to process that format. The
only value used at present is <code>1</code>, identifying the format
defined by this document.</p>

<p>The second byte is an identifier for the adapter used to drive the
encoding. This value is set by the encoder for information purposes
only; the decoder reads this value and makes it available to the
application but may not otherwise use it. This requirement is
intended to preserve compatibility between all XBIS adapters. There
are currently three values defined for this byte, <code>1</code> for
the SAX2 adapter, <code>2</code> for the DOM adapter, <code>3</code> for
the dom4j adapter, and <code>4</code> for the JDOM adapter.</p>

<p>The remaining two bytes of XBIS header are reserved for future
use. They are currently written as <code>0</code> values and are
ignored on input.</p>

<p>After the header the stream consists of one or more <i>nodes</i>.
These are the primary document structure components, representing
everything from a complete document down to a comment or character
data string. Attributes are <b>not</b> considered nodes in the XBIS
encoding, though, and are handled separately.</p>

<p>At the top level only two types of nodes are valid, element nodes
and document nodes (when XBIS is used for complete documents, only
the document nodes are valid at the top level). Each of these may in
turn contain other nodes (including element nodes) as content. The
content node definitions are nested within the definition of the
containing node.</p>

<p>Each node begins with a node definition byte, which may be
followed by additional information for the node. This node definition
byte uses different formats for different types of nodes, with the
high-order bits used as flags to identify the format.</p>

<h4>Element Nodes</h4>

<p>Element nodes use the format shown in Figure 4. The high-order bit of the
node definition byte is always a 1 for an element node, and the next two bits
are used as flags for whether the element has, respectively, attributes
(including namespace declarations) and content (0 if not, 1 if so). The
remaining bits are a quick value for the element name handle, extended if
necessary into the following byte(s). If the name has not previously been
defined, the new name definition immediately follows the node definition
byte.</p>

<table align=right cellpadding=5>
<caption><b>Figure 4. Node definition byte - Element</b></caption>
<tr><td><img src="images/node-element.gif" alt="Node definition byte - Element" align=right width=315 height=115/></td></tr>
</table>

<p>If the element has attributes, these are next. Attributes begin
with an attribute definition byte, taking one of the forms shown in
Figure 5. The top format is used for attributes with ordinary
(unshared) values. The bottom format is used for attributes with
shared values, which use handles to avoid encoding the same text
repeatedly. Both ordinary and shared attribute values may be used in
any combination.</p>

<table align=left cellpadding=5>
<caption><b>Figure 5. Attribute definition byte formats</b></caption>
<tr><td><img src="images/attribute-def.gif" alt="Attribute definition byte formats" align=left width=315 height=133/></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Both attribute definition byte formats use the low-order bits
of the byte for a quick value of the attribute name handle (extended,
if necessary, to the following byte(s)). If the name has not
previously been defined the name definition immediately follows the
attribute definition byte.</p>

<p>The actual value of the attribute is next. For ordinary values,
and for new shared values (as indicated by the flag in the attribute
definition byte), these are strings in the general format. For
previously-defined shared values the value is represented by a handle
which identifies the value text.</p>

<p>The list of attributes for an element is terminated by a <code>0</code>
value in place of an attribute definition byte (which can never be
<code>0</code>). If the node definition byte for the element does not
indicate that attributes are present this <code>0</code> value is not
included in the encoding.</p>

<p>If the element has content, the content nodes are next. The
content nodes can be of any type (subject to XML structure concerns -
a document as content of an element is obviously invalid, for
instance). Each begins with a node definition byte, and as with the
attributes the list of content nodes is terminated by a <code>0</code>
byte in place of a node definition byte.</p>

<table align=right cellpadding=5>
<caption><b>Figure 6. Node definition byte - Plain text</b></caption>
<tr><td><img src="images/node-plain-text.gif" alt="Node definition byte - Plain text" align=right width=315 height=43/></td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Text Nodes</h4>

<p>Plain text (ordinary character data) nodes use the format
shown in Figure 6. This gives the text length as a quick value in the
low-order bits of the node definition byte (extended, if necessary,
to the following byte(s)). It is followed by the actual encoded
characters of text.</p>

<table align=left cellpadding=5>
<caption><b>Figure 7. Node definition byte - Shared text</b></caption>
<tr><td><img src="images/node-shared-text.gif" alt="Node definition byte - Shared text" align=left width=315 height=43/></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Shared text nodes use the format
shown in Figure 7. This gives the handle for shared text in the
low-order bits of the node definition byte (extended, if necessary,
to the following byte(s)). If the text has not previously been
defined (as indicated by a 0 value for the handle), the text
definition immediately follows the node definition byte, as a string
in the general format.</p>

<p>Both types of text nodes can be used within a single document, in
any combination.</p>

<h4>Namespace Declaration Nodes</h4>
<p>Namespace declaration nodes can be used both to define new namespaces and
to reference previously-defined namespaces. The first byte uses the format
show in Figure 8, with a quick value field for a namespace definition handle
in the low-order bits. If the node is redeclaring a previously-defined
namespace the handle value will reference that namespace definition. As usual,
a handle value of <code>0</code> is used to indicate a new handle definition.
In this case the actual namespace definition (in the format described above,
under <b>Names and Namespaces</b>) follows the first byte.</p>

<table align=right cellpadding=5>
<caption><b>Figure 8. Node definition byte - Namespace</b></caption>
<tr><td><img src="images/node-namespace.gif" alt="Node definition byte - Namespace" align=right width=315 height=43/></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Namespace declarations always apply in the scope of an element. When a
namespace declaration node is used it must precede the element it applies
to. Namespaces may also be declared as part of an element or attribute name
definition, when the namespace applies to that name. When a namespace is
first defined it's assigned a namespace definition handle, and each time it's
declared it's assigned an active namespace handle. The active namespace handle
is only valid within the scope of the element declaring the namespace, while
the namespace definition handle is valid from the point of definition on.</p>

<p>Each namespace definition associates a particular prefix (which may be the
empty prefix) with a particular namespace URI. If multiple prefixes are
defined for the same namespace URI a separate namespace definition is
included in the serial form for each prefix. The actual URI will only be
encoded with the first namespace definition, though, and will be referenced
using a handle in any other </p>

<table align=right cellpadding=5>
<caption><b>Figure 9. Node definition byte - Other</b></caption>
<tr><td><img src="images/node-other.gif" alt="Node definition byte - Other" align=right width=315 height=43/></td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Other Nodes</h4>
<p>The other node types use a simple format in which the node
definition byte just identifies the type of node, and any additional
information for that node type is in the following bytes (with text
items using the general text format, as described under <b>Strings</b>,
above). These other node types are:
</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Document node: followed by content
	node list, as for element node</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Comment node: followed by actual
  comment text</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">CDATA node: followed by CDATA
	text</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Processing Instruction node:
	followed by target and value text items</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Document Type node: followed by name,
  public id, and system id text items</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Notation node: followed by name,
	public id, and system id text items</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Unparsed Entity declaration node:
  followed by name, public id, system id, and notation name text items</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Skipped Entity node: followed by
  the entity name text</p>
  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Element declaration node: followed by
  element name and content model text items</li>
  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Attribute declaration node: followed by
  owning element name, attribute name, attribute type, defaulting type, and
  default value text items</li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">External Entity declaration node:
  followed by name, public id, and system id text items</p>
</ol>
<p>The value <code>0</code> for a node definition byte is used to
indicate the end of a list of node definitions. All other values not included
in the above list are reserved and currently unused.</p>

<p>Note that most of these node types are not required for preserving the
canonical form of XML documents, since XML Canonicalization discards Document
Type, Notation, Unparsed/Skipped/External Entity, and Element/Attribute
declaration information. These types are supported by XBIS
to allow its use as a serialization mechanism for XML document
models, but they should be considered optional.</p>
