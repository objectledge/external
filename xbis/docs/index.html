<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">XBIS is an encoding format for XML
documents that is fully convertible to and from text, with information
set equivalence between the original document text and regenerated
document text. It's intended for use in transmitting XML documents
between application components, and is therefore designed for
processing speed. The current Java language implementation offers
several times the performance of SAX2 parsers working from text
documents across a wide range of document types and sizes, and across
JVMs tested, while also providing a substantial reduction in document
size for most types of XML documents.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">XBIS is the successor to the XML Stream
(XMLS) project which was developed in 2000-2001 to address the issue
of processing overhead when sending XML documents between application
components. The XMLS implementation was designed for use with
document models, so it took a document model as input and generated a
document model as output. Even though it demonstrated much better
performance than alternatives such as Java serialization, or
conversion to and from text, it offered no direct performance
comparison to parsing XML text because of its document-model focus.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The XBIS format is very similar to that used
by XMLS, with only a few differences. The main difference from XMLS is in
the internal details of the implementation, which has been restructured to
provide better support for working with parser event streams as input and
output. The current XBIS implementation uses a SAX2 event stream as input
in order to generate the binary encoding of a document, and generates a
SAX2 event stream as output when decoding the binary representation. Other
parser APIs are likely to be supported in the future, along with direct
conversion to and from document model representations of documents.</P>

<p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Even though both XMLS and XBIS are designed
around the needs of Java applications, the XBIS format is a general one that
can be implemented in any general purpose programming language. The encoding
format is based on long-established computing principles and has no known
"intellectual property" encumberances. This format is made available to any
interested parties free of restriction. The Java implementation code itself
uses the commercial-friendly BSD license.</p>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The main features that distinguish XBIS
from other techniques for representing XML documents are:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Full
	convertibility of arbitrary XML documents to and from text
	representation (all XML information content preserved),</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">On-the-fly conversion in both
	directions, so that output can begin as soon as the first input is
	received,</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Very high performance in terms of
	CPU usage, along with a modest reduction in document sizes,</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Streaming of documents with some
	state information retained between documents, allowing even further
	performance improvements and size reductions,</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Potential for additional
	optimizations by the application generating XBIS which will work
	without any special programming for the application
	receiving XBIS.</P>
</OL>

<p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The current version of XBIS is designed to
preserve the canonical form of text XML documents converted to and from XBIS.
This represents somewhat of a change in direction from earlier versions which
focused more on the XML Infoset. The reason for this change is that the Infoset
is an abstraction with very little direct application, while canonicalization is
a practical concern for many usages of XML (including XML Signature). This
change of focus has had very little direct impact on the XBIS format and
implementation. It has, however, eliminated the need to extend XBIS with support
for some rarely used aspects of the Infoset.</p>
