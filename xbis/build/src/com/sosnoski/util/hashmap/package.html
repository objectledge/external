<p>Type-specific hash map collections. The classes in this
package are basically equivalent to somewhat simplified and
type-specific versions of the
standard <code>java.util.Hashmap</code> or newer
<code>java.util.HashMap</code> class. They generally
use the method names defined by <code>HashMap</code> as opposed
to the older <code>Hashmap</code> names. The standard
public access methods in these classes are as follows:</p>

<center><table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tr bgcolor="#CCCCFF" class="TableHeadingColor"><td><font size="+1">Method Signature</font></td><td><font size="+1">From</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><code><i>type2</i> <b>add</b>(<i>type1</i>, <i>type2</i>)</code></td><td>implementation class</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>void <b>clear</b>()</code></td><td>{@link com.sosnoski.util.hashmap.PrimitiveKeyBase} or {@link com.sosnoski.util.hashmap.ObjectKeyBase}</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Object <b>clone</b>()</code></td><td>implementation class</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>boolean <b>containsKey</b>(<i>type1</i>)</code></td><td>implementation class</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>void <b>ensureCapacity</b>(int)</code></td><td>{@link com.sosnoski.util.PrimitiveHashBase} or {@link com.sosnoski.util.ObjectHashBase}</td></tr>
<tr><td><code><i>type2</i> <b>get</b>(<i>type1</i>)</code></td><td>implementation class</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Iterator <b>iterator</b>()</code></td><td>{@link com.sosnoski.util.hashmap.ObjectKeyBase} (not implemented for primitive keys)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code><i>type2</i> <b>remove</b>(<i>type1</i>)</code></td><td>implementation class</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>int <b>size</b>()</code></td><td>{@link com.sosnoski.util.PrimitiveHashBase} or {@link com.sosnoski.util.ObjectHashBase}</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Iterator <b>valueIterator</b>()</code></td><td>implementation class (not implemented for primitive values)</td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>As with <code>HashMap</code>, the access methods are
unsynchronized for best performance. The user program must implement
appropriate locking if multiple threads need to access an
instance of these classes while that instance may be modified.</p>

<p>Maps may use either a primitive type or an object type as
both keys and values. Two separate base classes are defined for
different classes of maps: {@link com.sosnoski.util.hashmap.PrimitiveKeyBase} for maps
with keys of primitive types, and {@link com.sosnoski.util.hashmap.ObjectKeyBase} for maps
with object keys.</p>

<p>Collections of object types may be configured to use any of three possible
combinations of hash method and key comparison techniques. The choice is determined by an
optional <code>tech</code> parameter to the constructor, with the following
values inherited from {@link com.sosnoski.util.ObjectHashBase}:
<ul>
<li><code>STANDARD_HASH</code> - use object <code>hashCode()</code> and <code>equals()</code> comparison
<li><code>IDENTITY_COMP</code> - use object <code>hashCode()</code> and <code>==</code> comparison
<li><code>IDENTITY_HASH</code> - use <code>System.identityHashCode()</code> and <code>==</code> comparison
</ul>
In testing with the Sun Java 1.3.1 JVM <code>System.identityHashCode()</code> turns out to be
very slow in comparison to a typical <code>hashCode()</code> implementation, so be careful of using
the <code>IDENTITY_HASH</code> option. <code>IDENTITY_COMP</code> is always faster than
<code>STANDARD_HASH</code>, though, so it's a good choice when you know that objects are unique
(such as <code>String</code>s which have been <code>intern</code>ed).</p>

<p>To define a hash map of a new type, derive from the appropriate
base class and define the necessary implementation methods. A pair
of useful hash map classes which can be used as model code for new
variations are included in the package, {@link com.sosnoski.util.hashmap.IntStringHashMap}
(mapping <code>int</code> keys to <code>String</code> values) and
{@link com.sosnoski.util.hashmap.StringIntHashMap} (mapping <code>String</code> keys to
<code>int</code> values). The source for these can be copied and
renamed as appropriate, then text substitutions used to
change the types (with some care in the case of "int", since this
type is used internally as well as for the keys or values).</p>

<p>Before launching into this, you may want to look at the
{@link com.sosnoski.util.hashset} package, which provides a
simpler view based on much of the same underlying code. That package
also contains a few more examples, including one for <code>double</code>
primitive keys.</p>

<p>Defining new hash map classes is generally not too useful for different types of object
keys, since none of the methods return keys. It is necessary for working with primitive
types as either keys or values (other than the combinations supplied), though, and can
also be worthwhile for different object value types.</p>

<p>If you work with primitive types as keys you'll also
need to define a hashing function (the <code>computeSlot</code> method in
these classes). Selecting a good hash computation method for your data
requires considerable research. The methods used in the provided code
have not been subjected to any serious testing and may be flawed by poor
distributions, which results in higher overhead for operations on the set.
If you're using hash-based collections heavily, make sure the hashing method
you choose works well with your data.</p>

<p>Hash maps of both object and primitive types use considerably less memory than
the corresponding standard Java library implementations, so a good approach to take
when using these collections in high-performance applications is to be generous in
setting the initial size for the tables. It may also improve performance if you lower the
<code>fill</code> parameter value, so that the tables are expanded more often.</p>
