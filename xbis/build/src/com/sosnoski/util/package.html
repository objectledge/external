<p>Base classes and general utility classes. These include the abstract base classes for
the several varieties of type-specific collection classes.</p>

<p>{@link com.sosnoski.util.GrowableBase} provides the basic implementation of a collection
which uses a growable array, with call out methods (abstract methods used by the
base class but defined by the subclass) for handling the particular needs of each
such type of collection. The array, queue, and stack collection classes are
all derived from this class.</p>

<p>{@link com.sosnoski.util.PrimitiveHashBase} and {@link com.sosnoski.util.ObjectHashBase} provide the
basic implementation of hash-based collection. These also use call out methods
for handling the particular needs of each
such type of collection. The hash map and hash set collection classes are
derived from this pair of classes.</p>

<p>{@link com.sosnoski.util.ArrayRangeIterator}, {@link com.sosnoski.util.WrappedArrayIterator} and
{@link com.sosnoski.util.SparseArrayIterator} provide <code>java.util.Iterator</code> implementations
for array-based collections. They're used by the collections classes to return iterators for
object collections, but can also be used directly by applications.</p>

<p>{@link com.sosnoski.util.CharBuffer} supports working with character
sequences (including arrays and <code>String</code>s) as a lightweight
<code>StringBuffer</code> workalike. It extends the {@link com.sosnoski.util.array.CharArray}
growable character array implementation with added support for append/insert/replace
operations on the character sequence, along with comparing various types of
character sequences and computing format-independent hash codes for character
sequences.</p>
